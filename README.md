# AI Spanish Flashcard AI Generator
This is a tool where you can insert new Spanish vocabulary, and it will automatically generate a flashcard with an AI-generated image corresponding to the vocabulary for you.

## Background 
As I was reading Fluent Forever: How to Learn Any Language Fast and Never Forget It, I was reminded of a simple vocabulary memorizing method: Don’t use translation! Use images!

## My old method
Yes, I did the image method before for Spanish clothing. Images are so much more fun than looking at boring translation words, but…

![Drawing](media/drawing.png)
Creating all these images took so much time, and lazy Esther ended up doing the translation method.

Nowadays, since AI can do lots of artwork, I started to imagine, can lazy Esther just ask AI to create the drawing part for her?
## My idea
This is my idea sketch. There are three simple ideas that come up to my mind.

1. Memory gallery: Whenever I input new vocab, AI will generate an image and store it in a flashcard library.

2. Matching Game: I can play a drag-and-drop matching game for the vocabulary in the memory gallery to review. (Note: But the most powerful memorizing method is still “recall” aka you look at the image and actively think of the word from your brain)

3. Practice with AI: I look like the photo, and try to describe the image with the vocabulary that I learn.

## Solution: Memory gallery
After seeing the possibility, I built a quick prototype for the memory gallery I was imagining.

## Next question
“Learn a word” for me means that I can easily apply it verbally in the sentence. Now, I can recognize the word, but how can I get to that application stage? What are the traditional methods that are effective? Can I use AI to practice with me?
